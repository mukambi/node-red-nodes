    <p>Raspberry Pi output to a HD44780 style LCD. Usually 1, 2, or 4 lines of characters.</p>
    <p>Expects a <code>msg.payload</code> with a string in it.</p>
    <p>Strings for the second line of the display must start <b>2:</b> - the third start <b>3:</b> - and the fourth <b>4:</b></p>
    <p>To clear the display send the string <b>clr:</b></p>
    <p>It is up to you to manage string lengths to suit the display.</p>
    <p>Requires the RPi.GPIO python library version 0.5.8 (or better) in order to work.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> we are using the actual physical pin numbers on connector P1 as they are easier to locate.</p>
