    <p>Extract <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format">Exif</a> information from JPEG images.</p>
    <p>This node expects an incoming JPEG image buffer in the selected property. If Exif data is present,
    it extracts the data into the <code>msg.exif</code> object.</p>
    <p>The node then adds location data as <code>msg.location</code>, should the Exif data carry this information.
    This also includes an icon, bearing and field of view arc suitable for use in the worldmap node.
    The selected input property retains the original, unmodified image buffer.</p>
    <p>If configured to use the worldmap in node then the existing image payload will be replaced by the location
    object so that it can be fed back to the map directly.</p>
